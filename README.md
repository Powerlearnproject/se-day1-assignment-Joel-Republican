#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering prinviples, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.It invlves the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software products.
Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of Programming Languagues(1960's): Such as Fotran and C
Advent of Structured Programming(1970's): Structured programming, or modular programming is a programming paradigm that faciliatates the creation of programs with readable code and reusable components.
Rise in Agile Methodologies(2000's): Agile methodologies are project mangement frameworks that break down projects into several dynamic phases, commonly known as sprints.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The software development life cycle(SDLC) consists of several phases, including:
Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and systemn requirements.
Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology: Sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall.

Agile Methodology: Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.
Waterfall Methodology is a project managment methodology that invovles upfront planning with minimal allowances for adjustment when plan has been finalized. Some of the advantages of using the waterfall approach include: clear roadmap for project executuion, minimal stress to engineering team and minimal cost in project execution.
Agile on the other hand in is a flexible and iterative approach that enables teams to quickly adapt to changing project requirements and deliver high quality results within shorter timeframes. Some of the advantages of using the agile methodology include flexibility and adaptability to changing user requirements.
Waterfall methodology is suitable for long term projects involving minimal plan changes and complexity such as a software roll out across regions for a period of one year.
Agile methodology is suitable for software projects requiring quicker time to market and changing user requirements for example software development for an innovative fintech startup.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
- Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
- Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA). It aids software development by enhancing productivity, faster debugging, and improved code accuracy.
VCS are Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion). Imporatnce include collaboration with project memebers, branching and merging code, managing and protecting the source code, and tracking changes to codebase.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Software engineers encounter various challenges throughout the development process, including:
  - Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
  - Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
  - Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Some of strategies for overcoming these challenges include:
Effective communictaion, adoption of agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassement of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Testing is a critical aspect of QA and involves various types of testing, including:
  - Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
  - Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
  - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
  - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Importance of Quality Control: Quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering involves the drafting of questions or statements in a manner to derive the most optimal responses from AI models.
Prompt engineering is important in the interaction with AI models to prevent vague responses and attain tailored made concise responses.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
What is demand?
"Tell me about the law of demand in relation consumer behaviour and market theory in economics"
The latter statement provides more focus for the prompt as it streamlines the AI into the field of finance and economics.
